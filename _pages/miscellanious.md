Here's some other miscellanious stuff about me:
- I'm originally from Bellevue, Washington (near Seattle). I moved to the Bay Area of California when I was ~13, but consider myself to be Cascadian through and through.
- A very long time ago, I got a black belt in TaeKwonDo, a form of Korean martial arts. 
- I did competitive Lincoln-Douglas debate in high school, and still regularly coach for my alma mater The Harker School (go Eagles!). I love thinking about competitive debate, maybe even more than I loved competing. 
- I'm proud to be the sibling of three brothers, one of which is a human student at Brandeis University (go Judges!) and the other two of whom are Australian Shepherds. 
- I'm the fourth "Quentin Clark" in my family, after my father, grandad, and great-grandad. 
- I was very briefly a student at San Diego State University (go Aztecs!) as a Global Campus student, studying Mandarin Chinese as part of Project Global Officer, which helps train ROTC students in forgein languages. Why I was there as a not-ROTC student is a long story.
- I owe a great deal to Boston University's undergraduate philosophy association and to their student journal of philosophy, Arche, for supporting my personal development.
