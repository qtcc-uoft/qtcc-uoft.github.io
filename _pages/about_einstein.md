I'm Quentin, currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I'm part of the [Robot Vision and Learning (RVL)](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) group, and I'm advised by Prof. [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/). Before this, I received a B.A. in Philosophy and a B.S. in Computer Engineering from Boston University. 

I am primarily interested in learned sequential decision-making, especially Reinforcement Learning. On the philosophy side, I enjoy thinking about Buddhist philosophy and existential risk problems.
